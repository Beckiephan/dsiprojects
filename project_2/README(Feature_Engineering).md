## Conclusions
The selected features that have been saved and imported to another notebook for model evaluation, were based on the relation between each features and the sale price. For the numerical features that were selected they are based on the correlation with a threshold set at 40% for both postive and negative correlation. They were also linearly related to price, meaning that there was a linear relationship where if the value of the feature increases, the price increases or decreases (this was seen in the pairplot). The categorical features chosen were base on the price sensitivity between each category of a feature as seen in the boxplot. If about one-third of the categories of a feature have a price difference of about 100,000 between the min and min or max and max of the 75% quartile between them, these were then selected as it would be features that would halp in training the model for price predictions. There are a few limitations to the features selected due to the range of data we have which might limit the models. For example, the range of age of houses when they were sold were mostly new (5 years or earlier) and there is very little data of houses sold in the range of 10 to 50 years old especially between 20 to 30, this might limit the ability to predict accurately the houses in those range. Another limitation could be that the model might not be good at predciting the houses that are bigger and more expensive. This is because the data is more skewed towards the houses that are smaller, which in turn is cheaper. The model would do well for Ames, Iowa as the houses sold are more on the lower range in price as seen from the graph and therefore tend to be smaller in size as well. Therefore, if we were to use this model for prediction of sale prices of houses in areas or states that have a higher household income, houses that have bigger square footage, resulting in higher sale price of houses, the model using these data, might not be as useful in prediction.
